# Decision-Tree
• Developed a Decision Tree model for regression tasks without relying on external libraries (manual implementation of Regression Tree)

• Applied rule post-pruning technique to the best-performing tree obtained and analyzed the variation in test accuracy with different tree depths.

• Visualized the pruned tree in a hierarchical manner.The visualization showcased the attributes at each level, providing a comprehensive understanding of the decision-making process and highlighting the key features driving the classification outcomes.
